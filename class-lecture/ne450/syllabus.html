# NE450: Principles of Nuclear Engineering

## Objective

Provide the fundamental knowledge basis for advanced study into the nuclear engineering field.

## Overview 

Nuclear engineering encompasses many different fields. In this course, an overview of fundamental nuclear engineering principles and how these are practically applied to contemporary, nuclear engineering problems will be presented.  The topics covered in this course include: nuclear physics and reactions, materials science, radiation protection, energy production, fuel cycle analysis, advanced reactor design, fusion, nonproliferation, back-end management, and risk assessment and safety.  Throughout the course, the ethical considerations with regards to engineering problems within these fields will also be discussed.

## Prerequisites

Material learned in any undergraduate engineering curriculum; chemistry, physics, calculus, differential equations. Familiarity with the usual software packages is expected. Scientific computing is very useful for many engineering problems, including nuclear engineering. Any skill in basic scripting, in python, for example, is encouraged. It is assumed that there is minimal knowledge about anything in nuclear engineering.

## [Code of student conduct](http://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/student-conduct/student-code-of-conduct)  

Realistically, much of professional engineering work is team-oriented. While it is ok to work in groups, students are expected to be familiar with the University of Idaho Student Code of Conduct.
