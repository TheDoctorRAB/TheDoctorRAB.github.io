# Research experience
**University of Idaho, Idaho Falls, College of Engineering, Nuclear Engineering Program**  
**Assistant Professor**  
Research efforts are focused on scientific computing applications to safeguardability of the advanced fuel cycle.  
*2015 - present*

**University of California-Berkeley, Department of Nuclear Engineering**  
**Postdoctorate researcher**  
A safeguards methodology is developed for remotely-handled nuclear materials facilities that proposes functional design components and a risk-informed framework in an effort to integrate safeguards with safety and security into facility design.  
*2009-12*

**The University of Tokyo, Department of Nuclear Engineering/Management**  
**Research associate**  
Mathematical models for mass transport in the engineered barrier system of a high-level nuclear waste repository are established for bentonite extrusion and radionuclide transport under different environmental conditions to assess potential impacts on performance assessment.  
*2007-09*

**University of California-Berkeley, Department of Nuclear Engineering**  
**Postdoctorate researcher**  
Mathematical modeling of mass transport in the engineered barrier system of a high-level nuclear waste repository continued, to assess the potential of extruding bentonite to confine radionuclides.  
*2007*

**University of California-Berkeley, Department of Nuclear Engineering**  
**Doctoral candidate**  
The dissertation thesis focused on the mathematical modeling of mass transport in the engineered barrier system of a high-level nuclear waste repository. A mass transport model was established for radionuclides in a porous medium, bentonite extrusion model in a planar fracture to assess the potential to confine radionuclides.  
*2005-06*

# Related research experience
**Earth Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory**  
**Intern**  
Conducted data analysis for chaotic modeling of water flow in the unsaturated zone.  
*2001-02*

**Leslie C. Wilbur Nuclear Reactor Facility, Worcester Polytechnic Institute**  
**Major Qualifying Project**  
The Major Qualifying Project synthesizes previous undergraduate studies to solve problems or perform tasks in the major field and communicate results effectively. For this project, a logic algorithm was developed for reactivity derived from point kinetics equations and a programmable logic controller was modified for real time collection of data during nuclear reactor operation for use with experimental coursework and maintenance procedures.  
*1995-96*
