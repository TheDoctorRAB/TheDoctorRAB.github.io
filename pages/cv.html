**Postdoctorate researcher**  
Mathematical modeling of mass transport in the engineered barrier system of a high-level nuclear waste repository continued, to assess the potential of extruding bentonite to confine radionuclides.  
*2007*

**University of California-Berkeley, Department of Nuclear Engineering**  
**Doctoral candidate**  
The dissertation thesis focused on the mathematical modeling of mass transport in the engineered barrier system of a high-level nuclear waste repository.
