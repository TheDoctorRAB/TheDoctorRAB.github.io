The topics covered in this course include: nuclear physics and reactions, materials science, radiation protection, energy production, fuel cycle analysis, advanced reactor design, fusion, nonproliferation, back-end management, and risk assessment and safety.  Throughout the course, the ethical considerations with regards to engineering problems within these fields will also be discussed.

*ENGIN110: Introduction to Engineering*
This course introduces students to fundamental engineering principles. Students learn how these are applied to contemporary engineering problems through laboratory exercises, homework assignments, design projects, interviews with professional engineers, and field trips to engineering companies. Topics include: materials science, risk assessment and safety, critical problem-solving, engineering analysis, engineering design processes, project development, engineering software, and
presentation tools. The role of the engineer in society, professionalism, and engineering ethics are major themes. The emphasis is on creative problem-solving, teamwork, and effective communication, both in presentation and writing.

*NE92: Issues in Nuclear Science and Engineering*
This course provides undergraduate students with an overview of the nuclear engineering profession, including fundamental nuclear engineering principles and how these are practically applied to nuclear engineering problems. The topics covered include nuclear physics and reactions, materials science, radiation protection, energy production, fuel cycle analysis, advanced reactor design, fusion, nonproliferation, back-end management, risk assessment, and safety. Throughout the course, the
ethical considerations concerning engineering problems within these fields are also addressed through a comprehensive, student-driven course project.

*NE375: Teaching Techniques in Nuclear Engineering*
This course acquaints graduate student instructors (GSIs) with teaching techniques for courses in the Department of Nuclear Engineering. The GSI will have several duties far beyond grading assignments and/or examinations: conducting discussion sessions, review lectures, or laboratory experiments. The GSI, therefore, needs to develop the appropriate tools to use when facing these pedagogical challenges. Three students from the 2010 course received the Outstanding Graduate
Student Instructor Award given by the UC-Berkeley Graduate Student Instructor Teaching & Resource Center.
*Fall 2011; 2010*

**The University of Tokyo, Department of Nuclear Engineering/Management**
**Part time lecturer**
*Technical English for Scientists*
This course provided the opportunity for non-native English speaking students to develop technical communication skills; i.e., presenting scientific and technical material to an informed audience at an international conference. In this course, the ‘assertion evidence design’ concept for technical presentation of scientific topics was applied to student research interests. Transmutable skills focused on the professional communication of scientific research in various public speaking
formats and a comfortable familiarity with the English language to establish a stronger foundation for technical writing.
